MicroSpark is \ldots

We explored the possibility to remove the driver entirely to achieve single-point-failure-free.
SparkDriverless is a totally decentralized system.
Means every worker in the cluster is exactly the same.
Even the client has similar mechanism with workers.
This allows any node, even the client, fails at any time, without break the computation process.
And also it has a much simpler model compared to original Spark.
