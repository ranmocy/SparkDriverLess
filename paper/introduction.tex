Spark Driver-less is a new model of distributed computation system based on
Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD)\cite{rdd} model.
There is no driver in the cluster, instead, only workers and clients.
They communicate with each other by broadcast.
In programming language, actor model describes a cooperation model that each object runs on its own thread,
and communicate by sending message.
Spark Driver-less uses similar idea that let each worker or client runs on its own node,
and communicate by broadcast messages.

Some basic terms is listed in Section~\ref{sec:terms}.
Detailed implementation and work flow is described in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}.
Some analyses is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:analyses}.
And Section~\ref{sec:future_work} discusses some further works.
